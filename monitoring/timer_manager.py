"""
Timer Manager Module for ErgoSense.

Purpose:
    Track how long posture issue conditions (e.g., neck_forward, shoulder_raised,
    face_too_close) remain active and determine when they have persisted long
    enough to justify an alert/reminder.

Key Concepts:
    - A "condition" is a boolean flag (True = active, False = inactive) evaluated
      every update cycle (e.g., each processed frame or throttled interval).
    - Each condition has an associated delay threshold (in seconds) specifying
      how long it must remain continuously active before triggering an alert.
    - Once a condition triggers, it will not re-trigger again until it first
      clears (goes False) and then re-accumulates time past the threshold again.

Usage Pattern:
    from monitoring.timer_manager import TimerManager

    delays = {
        "neck_forward": 30.0,
        "shoulder_raised": 30.0,
        "face_too_close": 10.0,
    }
    tm = TimerManager(delays)

    # Inside a loop (now = time.time()):
    triggers = tm.update({
        "neck_forward": posture_result.neck_forward,
        "shoulder_raised": posture_result.shoulder_raised,
        "face_too_close": posture_result.face_too_close,
    }, now)

    if triggers:
        # Pass to alert system
        alerts = alert_system.process(triggers, now)

Design Decisions:
    - The module does NOT enforce cooldowns (that is handled by the alert system).
    - Computation is O(number_of_conditions) each updateâ€”intentionally simple.
    - "Active time" is implicit (now - active_since) instead of accumulated time
      so that intermittent frame drops or variable update intervals are handled robustly.
    - If a condition toggles off (False), its state is reset (active_since cleared),
      requiring a full delay duration again before the next trigger.

Extensibility:
    - Additional metadata (e.g., cumulative active duration over a day) could be added
      by extending ConditionTiming.
    - A method could be introduced to return a structured diagnostic snapshot
      (e.g., for UI debug panels).

    Public API:
        - update(flags: Dict[str, bool], now: float) -> List[str]
            Process the current active/inactive state of each condition and
            return a list of condition names that just crossed their delay
            thresholds *this* update call.

        - get_state_snapshot(now: float) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float|None]]
            Obtain diagnostic info (active duration, delay threshold, etc.).

    Behavior Rules:
        1. When a condition transitions from False -> True, record active_since.
        2. While True, if (now - active_since) >= delay and no prior trigger
           occurred after this activation window, emit a trigger.
        3. When a condition transitions to False, clear active_since (reset).
        4. A condition must clear before it can trigger again.
